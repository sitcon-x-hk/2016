                    <p>
                        Open Source is not just about free of charge,
                        it also connect the developers, users, promoters and form a community.
                        Users report bugs, suggest features, developers implements the programme and
                        helping each other. In someone mind, Open Source meaning that free of charge and
                        cannot make any money. In this keynote, hoping to let the speaker to tell everybody
                        that it is not hard to contribute Open Source, it is something everyone can do.
                        Involving in Open Source also can make enough money.
                        Last but not least, encouraging everyone to contribute every small part they can in Open Source
                        to make the world better.
